# BookAIReader

BookAIReader is a Streamlit application that allows you to interact with PDF documents using AI. You can ask questions about the content of a PDF or extract key information to quickly understand its main points.

## Features

-   **Interactive Q&A:** Upload a PDF and ask questions about its content. The application uses Large Language Models (LLMs) to provide answers based on the document's text.
-   **Intelligent Summarization:** Get a customizable overview of your PDF. This feature allows you to:
    -   Select summary length (Short, Medium, Long, Comprehensive).
    -   Provide optional keywords to focus the summary on specific topics.
    -   Receive a summary along with key sentences extracted from the text.
    The "Comprehensive" option provides a detailed breakdown including main ideas, useful information, and quotable passages.
-   **Terminology and Concept Explanation:** Enter a term or phrase from the PDF (or any text) and optionally provide surrounding context. The AI will define the term, explain it in context (if provided), and list related concepts. This is useful for quickly understanding jargon or complex ideas.
-   **Experimental Misinformation Detection:** Paste a segment of text to analyze it for potential misinformation. The AI will identify controversial claims or statements that may lack evidence and provide a brief assessment. This feature is experimental and should be used with caution, always verifying information from reputable sources.

## How to Use
